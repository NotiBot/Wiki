# Noti's Dashboard Web Interface Initialization

In order to receive live notifications in your Discord server, you have two options to choose from for setting up Noti: the slash commands or the web dashboard.

## Web Dashboard Login
This guide will lead you through the step-by-step process of initializing Noti's dashboard web interface:

1. Head over to [https://notibot.app/dashboard](https://notibot.app/dashboard)
2. You will be prompted to sign in with your Discord account if you have not already. \
    • *Signing in with Discord allows Noti to provide you with a list of servers to select from that you have the Manage Server permission for.*
3. Once you have successfully logged in with your Discord, you should see the following screen: \

## Accessing User Settings
4. Connect your socials to synchronize roles on your server and manage your profile with the `Configure` button, which gives the following options to configure: \
    • **Birthday**: Set up your birthday date. Please ensure you are entering the correct date as this cannot be changed later. Format: DD/MM (e.g. 20/12) \
    • **Global Language**: Set your global language for Noti. \
    • **Kick**: Connect/disconnect your Kick.com account \
    • **Twitch**: Connect/disconnect your Twitch.tv account \
    • **Twitter**: Connect/disconnect your Twitter account

## Selecting a Discord Server To Manage
